# Branching overview

**Branches are cheap** - they're easy to create/delete/work with and don't take a lot of storage space.

**Branches make it easy to try new ideas** - instead of making a lot of commits to your master branch and then trying to revert them, create new branch. If ideas don't work out, throw away the branch.

**Branches allow to isolate features or sections of work** - useful when collaborating with others.

**There is one working directory** - when we switch branches, Git will switch context quickly. Git will handle swapping out all the files in working directory for us.
