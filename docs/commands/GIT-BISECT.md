## ðŸ“Œ How `git bisect` works?

Bisect needs **last known good revision** and **first known bad revision**. Then git will **automate** a process to help you figure out where in **between those** a bug was introduced.

Bisect checkouts code at **mid-point** where you can mark revision as good or bad after performing some tests. When you decide if revision is good or bad, then bisect will checkout code at **next mid-point** and so on.

## ðŸ“Œ Example

### Execute `git bisect`
