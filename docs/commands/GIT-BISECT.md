# ðŸ“‹ `git bisect` - use binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug

Useful to **find the commit** that introduced **a bug** in our code. 

Bisect needs **last known good revision** and **first known bad revision**. Then git will **automate** a process to help you figure out where in **between those** a bug was introduced.

Bisect checkouts code at **mid-point** where you can mark revision as good or bad after performing some tests. When you decide if revision is good or bad, then bisect will checkout code at **next mid-point** and so on.
