## ðŸ“Œ Renaming branches

You don't want to start renaming your branches **if other people are already using them by another name**.

## ðŸ“Œ Deleting branches

You can't delete checked out branch and branches which are not fully merged [ðŸ”—](#delete-checked-out-branch)

## ðŸ“Œ Example

Branch colored **green** means that this is checked out branch.

### List local branches

### Merged vs no merged

Knowing which branches are fully included in another branch is very useful. Especially, when we start deleting branches:

### Rename current branch

### Delete branch
