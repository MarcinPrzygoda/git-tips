## ðŸ“Œ Default branch name

The default branch name in Git is **master** (in GitHub it is **main**).

## ðŸ“Œ Branch naming convention

Remember, **every commit** on `main` branch is a **new release** by definition.

| BRANCH NAME           | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `develop`             | branch with an infinite lifetime (similarly to `main`) where development process is done                                                              |
| `release/version`     | branch preparing a release (branch off from `develop`, merge back into `develop` and `main`)                                                          |
| `feature/branch-name` | branch adding a new functionality during development process (branch off from `develop`, merge back into `develop`)                                   |
| `bugfix/branch-name`  | branch fixing a bug during development process (branch off from `develop`, `release` or `feature`, merge back into `develop`, `release` or `feature`) |
| `hotfix/branch-name`  | branch patching a bug on already released version (branch off from `main`, merge back into `main` and `develop` or `release`)                         |

## ðŸ“Œ Renaming branches

You don't want to start renaming your branches **if other people are already using them by another name**.

## ðŸ“Œ Deleting branches

You can't delete **checked out** branch and branches which are **not fully merged**. You need to use **force delete** [ðŸ”—](#delete-checked-out-branch)

## ðŸ“Œ Examples

Branch colored **green** means that this is checked out branch.

### List local branches

### Merged vs no merged

Knowing which branches are **fully included** in another branch is very useful. Especially, when we start deleting branches:

### Create local branch

### Rename current branch

### Delete branch

### Delete checked out branch

### Force delete branch
