## ðŸ“Œ Switch with uncommitted changes

You **cannot switch branches** if changes in working directory **conflict** [ðŸ”—](#switch-with-uncommitted-changes)

However, you can switch if:
- changes in working directory could be applied **without conflict**
- files **are not being tracked**

If you have a conflict, you can:
- **commit** the changes to the current branch
- **remove** the changes
- **stash** the changes - stashes are like a **little pocket** where you can put the changes and pull them out when you're ready
