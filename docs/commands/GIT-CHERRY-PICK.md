## ðŸ“Œ Cherry-picking commits

**Cherry-picking** means that we apply the changes from one or more **existing commits**. Each existing commit is recorded as **a new commit** on the current branch.

It is conceptually similar to **copy-paste operation**. However, new commits have **different** SHA-1 hash.

You can cherry-pick commits from any branch that is **visible** to you. However, you cannot cherry-pick **a merge commit**.

## ðŸ“Œ Conflicts when cherry-picking

When you `cherry-pick` a commit, it's possible for it to **have conflicts**. And if you do have conflicts, it will work just like [merge conflicts](../concepts/MERGE-CONFLICTS.md) do.
