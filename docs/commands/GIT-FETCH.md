# ðŸ“‹ `git fetch`

Fetch is basically just checking with a remote server to make sure that you have **all the information** about what's on that remote server. It **doesn't merge** anything into your existing branches.

You should:
- fetch **before you start work everyday**
- fetch **before you push**
- fetch **before you go offline** (so you can continue work without Internet access)
- fetch **often**
