| COMMAND                       | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                        |

| `git merge <branch>`          | merge changes from `<branch>` into current local branch [ðŸ”—](#merge-branch)                                         |
| `git merge <tracking-branch>` | merge changes from `<tracking-branch>` into current local branch                                                   |
| `git merge`                   | when remote branch is tracked, you don't have to specify `<tracking-branch>` parameter [ðŸ”—](#merge-tracking-branch) |

## ðŸ“Œ Fast-forward vs true merge

**Fast-forward merge** does not make a new commit to merge things together. Git just simply **move** commits into the current branch [ðŸ”—](#fast-forward-merge)

**True merge** (or **non-fast-forward merge**) makes a new commit which joins two branches together. It is done, when one or more commits are done on current branch, but they're not present on merged branch [ðŸ”—](#true-merge)

Most of the time you'll **let git handle merge process** and decide whether it should be a fast-forward or non-fast-forward merge.
