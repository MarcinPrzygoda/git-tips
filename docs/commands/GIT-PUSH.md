## ðŸ“Œ Force Push

We use force push when:
- local version is **better** than the remote version
- remote version went wrong and needs **repair**
- versions have diverged and merging is **undesirable**

Use it with **extreme caution**. It is an easy way to anger your whole development team, because other commits can **disappear**. Any subsequent commits that they've made in their local repository that were dependent on those commits, are now **orphaned**.

## ðŸ“Œ Example

### Push committed changes on branch into remote repository

### Push committed changes on branch into remote repository and add upstream

### Delete remote branch (old style way)
