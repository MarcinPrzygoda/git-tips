# ðŸ“‹ `git rebase` - reapply commits on top of another base tip

Rebasing means that we **take commits** from **branch** and **replay them** at the end of **another branch**. It is useful to integrate recent commits **without merging**. It maintains a **cleaner**, more **liner project history**.

## ðŸ“Œ Conflicts when rebasing

When you `rebase` a branch, it's possible for it to **have conflicts**. And if you do have conflicts, it will work just like [merge conflicts](../concepts/MERGE-CONFLICTS.md) do. One difference is that after we resolve the conflicts, we go to the **next commit** and keep going down the chain of commits.

## ðŸ“Œ Merge vs Rebase

See [Merge vs Rebase](../concepts/MERGE-VS-REBASE.md)

## ðŸ“Œ How to undo a rebase

You can undo a simple rebase by:
- [`git rebase --hard ORIG_HEAD`](../commands/GIT-RESET.md), unless `ORIG_HEAD` has changed again (`rebase`, `reset`, `merge` change `ORIG_HEAD`)
- rebasing to former `merge-base` SHA-1 hash: `git rebase --onto <former-commit> <upstream-branch> <branch>`
