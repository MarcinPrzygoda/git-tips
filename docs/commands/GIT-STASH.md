# ðŸ“‹ `git stash` - stash the changes in a dirty working directory away

Stashes are like a **little pocket** where you can put the changes and pull them out when you're ready.

The stash is not part of the repository, the staging index or the working directory. It's a special fourth area of Git, **separate from others**.

Changes in the stash are **independent of the branches** that you're on. It means that stashes are available on all of the branches.

## ðŸ“Œ Conflicts when popping/applying changes

When you `pop` or `apply` changes out of your stash back into your working directory, it's possible for it to **have conflicts**. And if you do have conflicts, it will work just like a `merge` does.
