# ðŸ“‹ BRANCHING

## ðŸ“Œ Branches are cheap

They're easy to create/delete/work with and don't take a lot of storage space.

## ðŸ“Œ Branches make it easy to try new ideas

Instead of making a lot of commits to your `main` branch and then trying to revert them, create new branch. If ideas don't work out, throw away the branch.

## ðŸ“Œ Branches allow to isolate features or sections of work

Useful when collaborating with others.

## ðŸ“Œ There is one working directory

When we switch branches, Git will switch context quickly. Git will handle swapping out all the files in working directory for us.
