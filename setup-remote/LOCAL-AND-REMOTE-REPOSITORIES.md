# ‚≠ê Local and remote repositories

Local Git repositories **do not require a network connection**.

Remote repositories ("remotes") are **hosted by servers over a network**. They allow easy collaboration.

With a remote server, we can take the changes we've made in our local Git repository and put them on a remote server, so that other people can **access** them.

Git is designed to be **distributed version control**.

`origin/<branch>` is a `<branch>` on our local machine that **references** the remote server branch and it always tries to stay **in sync** with that remote branch.
